            <p>This is where we talk a bit more about the company.  Perhaps the services on offer, the company history, portfolio; any more verbose points that won't fit into one of the headlines displayed in the main window.</p>
            <p>We can talk at length in this section.  In fact, it makes the page work a bit better if there's plenty of text here, because there's more freedom for the user to scroll through.</p>
            <p>So, the more we can say here, the better.  We will probably save navigation for another section of the page, and we could also have useful links right at the bottom.</p>
            <p>We might find that large screens show all of this text at the same time anyway.  We could move it somewhere else for people viewing on mobiles.</p>
